# Medical_Disease_Diagnosis_nexus_hackathon_2025

Our goal in this hackathon was to implement an AI Model which diagnoses the disease a person might be suffering using the symptoms decribed by the user.Our website had an interactive chatbot which gets the symptoms of the user, the duration of the symptom and how severe the user thinks his/her symptoms are.Based on this the model interacts with the user and gives the preliminary diagnosis and gives suggestions about when the user should consult the doctor or rather self cure at home.

Additionally the website has additional features such as appointment booking for a specific doctor, searching for doctors in various specializations and fields for treatment followed by the appointment booking if required,booking lab tests in advance.In addition to that, different organ donors in the user's nearby region are also displayed.

This was a collaborative effort with my teammates M Menmangai ,Sanjana Raghunath and myself Sakshee Ujjwal Kumat.I would like to thank them for their support,collaboration,dedication and patience for making this project a success.
